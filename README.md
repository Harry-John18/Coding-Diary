## Weekly Summaries

### Week 1 (Jan 29 - Feb 4)

* **Focus: HTML Basics and Git**
    * **Why it matters:** If your focus is HTML, you shouldn't worry if your page looks ugly (CSS) or doesn't do anything (JS).
    * **Key Takeaway:** I focused strictly on semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`) and mastering basic Git commands (`add`, `commit`, `push`) to establish a solid workflow.

* ** Wins: Built my first static webpage**
    * **Reflection:** This was a tangible outcome. Using all the tags I learned in HTML basics, I understood how a website is actually structured. I successfully built my first static webpage using these core concepts.
    * > *"Coding is hard; celebrating small victories keeps you from burning out."*
