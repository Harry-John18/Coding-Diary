 My Coding Diary

Weekly Summaries
Week 1 (Jan 1 - Jan 7)

Focus: HTML Basics and Git
Why it matters:  If your focus is HTML, you shouldn't worry if your page looks ugly (CSS) or doesn't do anything (JS).
Focus on semantic tags (<header>, <main>) and basic Git commands (add, commit, push).

Wins: Built my first static webpage
A tangible outcome.where using all the tags i learned in html basics i learned to create how actually website is created and finally i created my static webpage using basics of html.
Quote-Coding is hard; celebrating small victories keeps you from burning out.
