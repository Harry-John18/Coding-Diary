## 📝 Topic: HTML5 Structure & Forms

### 🧠 What I Learned
**Objective:** Moving beyond basic text tags to build accessible, meaningful page structures and handle user input.

* **Semantic HTML:** Learned the importance of using specific tags like `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<section>` instead of generic `<div>` tags to improve accessibility and SEO.
* **Forms & Inputs:** Explored different input types (Text, Password, Checkbox, Radio) and how to group them.
* **Media Elements:** How to properly embed Images (`<img>`), Audio, Video, and SVGs.
* **Hyperlinks:** The critical difference between **Absolute** links (full URL) and **Relative** paths (local files).

**👉 Diary Task:** Built a "Registration Page" featuring a name field, a country dropdown menu, and a bio text area.

### 🚧 Problems Faced
1.  **Broken Image Paths:** My profile picture rendered as a broken icon. I was confused about how to reference a file located in a folder "above" my current file (`../`).
2.  **Unwanted Form Refresh:** Every time I clicked "Submit," the page reloaded instantly, clearing all the data I had just typed before I could see the result.
3.  **Invalid Nesting:** I placed a `<div>` block inside a `<p>` tag. The browser tried to fix it automatically, which caused my layout to look broken and disjointed.

### 💡 How I Solved Them
1.  **Fixing Paths:** I reorganized my files, moving images to a dedicated `assets/images/` folder. I updated the code to `src="./assets/images/pic.jpg"` and started using VS Code's autocomplete to ensure the path was valid.
2.  **Preventing Default Submit:** I learned that `<form>` tags have a default behavior to send data and reload. To stop this while testing, I added `onsubmit="return false"` to the form tag.
3.  **W3C Validation:** I used the **W3C HTML Validator** tool to debug the layout. It flagged the nesting error immediately. I replaced the inner `<div>` with a `<span>` (an inline element), which is valid inside a paragraph.
